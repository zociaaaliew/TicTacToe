# TicTacToe
 This is a simple 2-player, 3 by 3 board TicTacToe game. The players are asked for their names. The first user who enter their name first is the default player 1(X) and the second user is the default player 2(O). The players will take turns to make a move by entering a box number. All valid entry will be recorded and updated to the game board. Any player can win the game by having 3 consecutive markers in a row (vertical, horizontal, diagonal). The players will draw if the game board is full and none of the players win.
